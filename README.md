## Overview
**SahiMatch.AI** is an AI-driven partial invoice matching system that leverages a combinatory approach of Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and fuzzy logic. It is designed to intelligently match invoice numbers between two datasets‚Äîeven when confronted with challenges such as partial data, formatting differences, or human errors. The system provides detailed reports on classification and similarity between invoices and features a drag-and-drop interface for uploading files, editing predictions, and manual review. Through reinforcement learning, it continuously improves over time as it learns from user corrections.

## Problem Statement
**Intelligent Partial Invoice Matching**

Matching invoice numbers between two datasets is inherently challenging due to:
- **Partial Data:** Invoices may be truncated or missing prefixes/suffixes.
- **Discrepancies:** Minor formatting differences, extra spaces, special characters, or human errors.
- **Multiple Potential Matches:** Situations where multiple entries appear similar, leading to ambiguity.

**Objective:**  
Develop an AI/ML-powered solution that:
- **Automatically matches** invoice numbers even when only partial or inconsistent data is available.
- **Recommends potential matches** with a confidence score (on a scale from 1 to 100) for entries with low certainty.
- **Facilitates manual matching** via an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, enabling users to edit, freeze, or confirm predictions.
- **Learns from user corrections** using reinforcement learning to continuously improve matching accuracy over time.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- **High accuracy** in identifying exact, partial, and unmatched invoice entries.
- A **self-learning model** that adapts and refines its predictions through ongoing user feedback.
- A **comprehensive final report** (e.g., an Excel sheet) detailing which invoice entries were matched, along with their confidence scores and underlying reasoning.
